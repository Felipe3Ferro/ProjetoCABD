# 🛠️ CRUD with Java  

This is a **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application developed in **Java**, using **Apache NetBeans** as the dependency manager. The project allows data manipulation stored in an **SQL** database.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Java 8**  
- **Apache NetBeans**  
- **Apache Tomcat 8.5**  
- **MySQL (or any compatible SQL database)**  

## 📥 How to Set Up the Environment  

### 🔹 **Prerequisites**  
Make sure you have the following software installed:  
1. [Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/)  
2. [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/)  
3. [Apache Tomcat 8.5](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi)  
4. [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) (or any other SQL manager)  
5. [Download this repository](https://github.com/gustavottc/CRUD-Java/archive/master.zip)  

### 🔹 **Project Setup**  

#### **1️⃣ Setting Up in NetBeans**  
1. Open **NetBeans IDE**.  
2. Go to:  
   - `"File"` → `"Open Project"`  
   - Select the directory where you downloaded the repository and click `"Finish"`.  
3. Right-click on the project and select:  
   - `"Run"` to start the system.  

#### **2️⃣ Setting Up the Server**  
1. In NetBeans, go to the **"Servers"** tab (if you can't find it, use the **"Quick Access"** search bar).  
2. Add **Apache Tomcat 8.5**.  

#### **3️⃣ Configuring the Database (SQL)**  
1. Ensure that **MySQL** is running on the default port `3306`.  
2. Create the database using the **Banco_Hospital.txt** file included in the project.  

## ▶️ Running the Application  

1. **Start Tomcat in NetBeans**.  
2. **Verify the connection with the SQL database**.  
3. **Run the application in NetBeans**.  

Your CRUD is now ready to use! 🚀
